ProjectIdeas
============

###### Go Language
* JSON parser
* Create a full-stack application with GO as the server-side language

###### Music and hardware
* better looping program for guitar
* Content-curation web application - where users create a series of top 5 lists (instead of sharing tweets or photos, share your “Top 5 __________”, top 5 tech articles of the day, top 5 beatles songs, top 5 tv shows of the moment, top 5 books of the moments, etc). Follow people based on shared interests and tastes, and discover new content based on who you follow. Each item in a list is a sort of portal that takes you to all others who have the same rankings/lists (think #hashtag) or to the actual article, spotify song link, show on netflix, etc.

###### Data analytics
* predictive modeling for sports teams 
* Gaming the stock market using sentiment analysis of Twitter in R
* A new approach to predictive time series data analytics without mathematical models or scientifc theories.  Just big data.
* Distributed computing open platform built on Mesos where anyone can build a project, and anyone can sign up their computer to contribute to the processing.  Think that old SETI screensaver. Technologies: Mesos, Docker, Hadoop, mapreduce...

###### Theoretical/academic
* Javascript parser/interpreter - possibly extend to include analysis and visualizations of time and space complexity
* Use ethereum - create distributed system for verifiable and anonymous voting using block-chain concept.
